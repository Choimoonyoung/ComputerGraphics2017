# ComputerGraphics2017

All of the basic technics of computer graphics with OPENGL such as object rotation, scale, and lights so on.
Also, I did a term project with other 2 colleagues, and we made a scene with Shader(reflection, refraction, cartoon rendering and Static/Dynamic environment mapping) and Collision Detection. The whole code is updated in shared repository.
